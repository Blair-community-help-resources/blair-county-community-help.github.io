<h2><strong>Cred Bot</strong></h2>
<p> 
  The Cred Bot is an ongoing project that is a "fun" type bot along with some useful features. I am invested in making this bot unique, one that is different from many of the popular Discord bots that you could add to your server. 
</p>
 <p>
   <strong>Language:</strong> Python 
  <br>
   <strong>Features:</strong>
  <ul>
    <li>Give and take "cred" from members of the server (limited to 50 cred per day).</li>
  <li>"Cash in" cred for rewards such as muting, deafening or kicking another member of the server.</li>
  <li>Text alerts on voice channel join for enabled umembers.</li>
  <li>Custom admin text alerts to enabled members.</li>
  <li>Request a temporary email and recieve emails through Cred Bot </li>
  <li>"Wake up" calls to members phones at a member-specified time. Also good for finding a lost phone! </li>
   </ul>
  </p>
   <br>
   <p>
   <strong>Current Goals/Roadmap:</strong>
   <ul>
  <li>Migrate the bot to Azure or Google Cloud hosting.</li>
  <li>After migration, swap from Replit DB to MongoDB </li>
  <li>Research the potential of a discord phone with discord.js</li>
  <li>General Cleanup</li>
   </ul>
   </p>

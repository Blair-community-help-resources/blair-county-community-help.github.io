<p style="text-align:center;">My name is Shawn Brown, I'm a prospective Junior Software Developer eager to join the world of professional software development! To begin, I'm 23 years old and started programming when I was 14, on January 25, 2013 to be specific. I've since expanded to JavaScript, C#, C++, HTML/CSS, SQL, and Visual Basic and I love utilizing each and every one of them, though Python is still my favorite. I joined the US Army Reserves in 2016 at 17 years old as a Combat Engineer, serving one deployment overseas and a total of 6 years to which I'm very proud of. I currently hold a SECRET US Government security clearance from my service in the Army. In the middle of my service, I began studying at Mount Aloysius College for a Bachelor of Science in Information Technology to which I am expected to graduate spring 2023. I also have a strong interest in Cybersecurity, competing with the Mount Aloysius College Cyber Defense Team in the 2022 NCL Competition (Password cracking with HashCat was fun!).
